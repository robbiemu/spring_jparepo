# spring_jparepo
## Step by step overview of creating a simple csi-style spring/jpa crud project

Peter walked us through doing the hibernate transactions ourselves, and that way is what I call the "hard way" because you have to do all of the code manually. Michael's been showing us the "easy way", using JPARepository and autogenerating the tables. This project is a review of Michael's way. Each branch is a step in the process, and can be viewed like an article. Feel free to follow along.
